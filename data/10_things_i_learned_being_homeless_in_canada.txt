The Authorities Treat You Like Dirt
Men Find It Hard To Get Help
Panhandlers Do Not Make A Lot Of Money

You Spend A Lot Of Time In Line
You Will Steal And Be Stolen From Constantly
You Can Have As Much Sex As You Want
I Didn’t Know Anyone Who Was Starving
You Don’t Necessarily Look Homeless
You Are Not Necessarily Poor
