It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.
I have good looking kids. Thank goodness my wife cheats on me.
I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out.
My marriage is on the rocks again, yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.
I had plenty of pimples as a kid. One day I fell asleep in the library. When I woke up, a blind man was reading my face.
I was so ugly my mother used to feed me with a sling shot.
My wife is always trying to get rid of me. The other day she told me to put the garbage out. I said to her I already did. She told me to go and keep an eye on it.
The way my luck is running, if I was a politician I would be honest.
I saved a girl from being attacked last night. I controlled myself.
I could tell my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.
I told my psychiatrist that everyone hates me. He said I was being ridiculous - everyone hasn't met me yet.
My psychiatrist told me I was crazy and I said I want a second opinion. He said okay, you're ugly too.
Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt. Because in every room he leaves a pyramid.
I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.
My uncle's dying wish - he wanted me on his lap. He was in the electric chair.
This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me.
My wife met me at the door the other night in a sexy negligee. Unfortunately, she was just coming home.
When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them.
I found there was only one way to look thin: hang out with fat people.
I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her.
