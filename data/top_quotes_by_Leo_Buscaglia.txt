Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.
We all need each other.
Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself.
It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.
If I don't have wisdom, I can teach you only ignorance.
I still get wildly enthusiastic about little things... I play with leaves. I skip down the street and run against the wind.
The minute we stop learning, we begin death, the process of dying. We learn from each other with every action we perform. We are teaching goodness or evil every time we step out of the house and into the street.
Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.
Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations.
Life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized.
I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it's apathy. It's not giving a damn.
Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love.
Hugs make you feel psychologically more secure and together.
The best students come from homes where education is revered: where there are books, and children see their parents reading them.
Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.
Only the weak are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.
Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
Change is the end result of all true learning.
A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world.
