I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart's affections, and the truth of imagination.
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.
'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest.
My imagination is a monastery and I am its monk.
Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by singularity, it should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.
I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks, your loveliness and the hour of my death. O that I could have possession of them both in the same minute.
Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?
There is nothing stable in the world; uproar's your only music.
The only means of strengthening one's intellect is to make up one's mind about nothing, to let the mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts.
Love is my religion - I could die for it.
He ne'er is crowned with immortality Who fears to follow where airy voices lead.
There is an electric fire in human nature tending to purify - so that among these human creatures there is continually some birth of new heroism. The pity is that we must wonder at it, as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish.
You are always new, the last of your kisses was ever the sweetest.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever: its loveliness increases; it will never pass into nothingness.
Now a soft kiss - Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss.
The poetry of the earth is never dead.
Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced.
Scenery is fine - but human nature is finer.
I love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.
