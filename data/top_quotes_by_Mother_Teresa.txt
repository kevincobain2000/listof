The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted.
If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.

Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own.

We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless. The poverty of being unwanted, unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty.
Joy is prayer; joy is strength: joy is love; joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.

If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.
We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.
Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.
Peace begins with a smile.
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.
