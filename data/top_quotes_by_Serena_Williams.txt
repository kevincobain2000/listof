If you can keep playing tennis when somebody is shooting a gun down the street, that's concentration.
Hopefully, we can build a rivalry and we'll be able to do this a lot. Make a legacy, then retire champions.
I'm not used to crying. It's a little difficult. All my life I've had to fight. It's just another fight I'm going to have to learn how to win, that's all. I'm just going to have to keep smiling.
Venus told me the other day that champions don't get nervous in tight situations. That really helped me a lot. I decided I shouldn't get nervous and just do the best I can.
I'm really exciting. I smile a lot, I win a lot, and I'm really sexy.
I wanted to get really fit. I wanted to lose some weight. So I've been doing Pilates and yoga, trying to lean out my body so I won't be bulky.
I feel like I'm really young and I'm only thinking about my career and continuing playing.
No one likes getting their nails done more than I do.
I've had to learn to fight all my life - got to learn to keep smiling. If you smile things will work out.
Having a pulmonary embolism is definitely easier than heart break.
If anything, you know, I think losing makes me even more motivated.
I am not a robot. I have a heart and I bleed.
Everyone's dream can come true if you just stick to it and work hard.
Tennis just a game, family is forever.
I want to be a giving woman and just a nice person in general.
I don't know if I've had my share of drama, but I've definitely had my share of hard times.
Luck has nothing to do with it, because I have spent many, many hours, countless hours, on the court working for my one moment in time, not knowing when it would come.
I've always been a fighter and I've always fought through things my whole life.
I love who I am, and I encourage other people to love and embrace who they are. But it definitely wasn't easy - it took me a while.
Since I don't look like every other girl, it takes a while to be okay with that. To be different. But different is good.
