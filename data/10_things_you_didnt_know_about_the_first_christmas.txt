The Christmas Star May Have Been A Planetary Conjunction
Mary And Joseph Were Married When Jesus Was Born
The Wise Men Weren’t Kings
There Weren’t Three Wise Men
The Shepherds Didn’t Follow The Star
The Wise Men Didn’t Arrive The Night Jesus Was Born
Mary Didn’t Give Birth The Night She Arrived
There Wasn’t A Stable
There Wasn’t An Inn
It Didn’t Happen In December
