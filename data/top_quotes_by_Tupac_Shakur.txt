We all gonna die, we bleed from similar veins.
America wants its respect.
With all my fans I got a family again.
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?

I would rather have been shot straight-up in cold blood-but to be set up? By people who you trusted? That's bad.
It's a struggle for every young Black man. You know how it is, only God can judge us.
It's the game of life. Do I win or do I lose? One day they're gonna shut the game down. I gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as I can before it's my turn to leave.

I'm a reflection of the community.
All I'm trying to do is survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty, unbelievable lifestyle that they gave me.

Don't change on me. Don't extort me unless you intend to do it forever.
My mama always used to tell me: 'If you can't find somethin' to live for, you best find somethin' to die for.'
There's nobody in the business strong enough to scare me.
Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.
I don't have no fear of death. My only fear is coming back reincarnated.
