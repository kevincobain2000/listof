People seldom do what they believe in. They do what is convenient, then repent.
What's money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.
He not busy being born is busy dying.
All I can do is be me, whoever that is.
I accept chaos, I'm not sure whether it accepts me.
I kinda live where I find myself.
A poem is a naked person... Some people say that I am a poet.
Chaos is a friend of mine.
There is nothing so stable as change.
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie.
Yesterday's just a memory, tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be.
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings. And I've never been too impressed.
At times in my life the only place I have been happy is when I am on stage.
You're going to die. You're going to be dead. It could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow, anytime. So am I. I mean, we're just going to be gone. The world's going to go on without us. All right now. You do your job in the face of that, and how seriously you take yourself you decide for yourself.
I define nothing. Not beauty, not patriotism. I take each thing as it is, without prior rules about what it should be.
A mistake is to commit a misunderstanding.
I don't think the human mind can comprehend the past and the future. They are both just illusions that can manipulate you into thinking theres some kind of change.
No one is free, even the birds are chained to the sky.
A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom.
Take care of all your memories. For you cannot relive them.
