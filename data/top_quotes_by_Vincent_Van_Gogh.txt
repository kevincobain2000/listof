Painting is a faith, and it imposes the duty to disregard public opinion.
Paintings have a life of their own that derives from the painter's soul.
I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.
I can very well do without God both in my life and in my painting, but I cannot, suffering as I am, do without something which is greater than I am, which is my life, the power to create.
One must work and dare if one really wants to live.
The way to know life is to love many things.
How can I be useful, of what service can I be? There is something inside me, what can it be?
I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.
There may be a great fire in our hearts, yet no one ever comes to warm himself at it, and the passers-by see only a wisp of smoke.
But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.
When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion. Then I go out and paint the stars.
One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever came to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on their way.
If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.
As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed.
Conscience is a man's compass.
I wish they would only take me as I am.
For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.
I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.
I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.
Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.
