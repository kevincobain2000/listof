Fashion is always of the time in which you live. It is not something standing alone. But the grand problem, the most important problem, is to rejeuvenate women. To make women look young. Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous.
There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time!
I invented my life by taking for granted that everything I did not like would have an opposite, which I would like.
As long as you know men are like children, you know everything!
Gentleness doesn't get work done unless you happen to be a hen laying eggs.
I never wanted to weigh more heavily on a man than a bird.
Fashion is made to become unfashionable.
As soon as you set foot on a yacht you belong to some man, not to yourself, and you die of boredom.
I don't know why women want any of the things men have when one of the things that women have is men.
Jump out the window if you are the object of passion. Flee it if you feel it. Passion goes, boredom remains.
It is always better to be slightly underdressed.
Great loves too must be endured.
Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury.
Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.
Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.
Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity.
In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different.
Fashion fades, only style remains the same.
Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.
A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous.
