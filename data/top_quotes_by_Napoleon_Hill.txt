Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.
Think and grow rich.
All achievements, all earned riches, have their beginning in an idea.
Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once, whether you ready or not, to put this plan into action.
Until you have formed the habit of looking for the good instead of the bad there is in others, you will be neither successful nor happy.
Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel.
There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.
When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.
The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.
Until you have learned to be tolerant with those who do not always agree with you, you will be neither successful nor happy.
You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.
Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought.
Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality; man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true.
If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.
Money without brains is always dangerous.
A goal is a dream with a deadline.
Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.
Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.
Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.
