You have to forget about what other people say, when you're supposed to die, or when you're supposed to be loving. You have to forget about all these things.
I'm gonna put a curse on you and all your kids will be born completely naked.
If I'm free, it's because I'm always running.
It's funny how most people love the dead, once you're dead, you're made for life.
When I die, I want people to play my music, go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do.
Blues is easy to play, but hard to feel.
You have to give people something to dream on.
I'm the one that has to die when it's time for me to die, so let me live my life, the way I want to.
You have to go on and be crazy. Craziness is like heaven.
If it was up to me, there wouldn't be no such thing as the establishment.
All I'm gonna do is just go on and do what I feel.
Excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.
Music is a safe kind of high.
I used to live in a room full of mirrors; all I could see was me. I take my spirit and I crash my mirrors, now the whole world is here for me to see.
I've been imitated so well I've heard people copy my mistakes.
Even Castles made of sand, fall into the sea, eventually.
The story of life is quicker than the blink of an eye, the story of love is hello, goodbye.
Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.
