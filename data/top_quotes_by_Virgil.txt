It is easy to go down into Hell; night and day, the gates of dark Death stand wide; but to climb back again, to retrace one's steps to the upper air - there's the rub, the task.
Love begets love, love knows no rules, this is same for all.
Myself acquainted with misfortune, I learn to help the unfortunate.
Fate will find a way.
Come what may, all bad fortune is to be conquered by endurance.
Trust one who has tried.
Time flies never to be recalled.
There's a snake lurking in the grass.
It never troubles the wolf how many the sheep may be.
Endure the present, and watch for better things.
Love conquers all.
Go forth a conqueror and win great victories.
Time passes irrevocably.
Trust not too much to appearances.
Every calamity is to be overcome by endurance.
Do not yield to misfortunes, but advance more boldly to meet them, as your fortune permits you.
They succeed, because they think they can.
Fear is proof of a degenerate mind.
Fortune favours the bold.
They can conquer who believe they can.
