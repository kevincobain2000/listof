First of all, Vince McMahon doesn't argue - he tells you!
I had my first 'Survivor Series' in 1991 and I was fortunate enough to be an instrumental part of the shows I was on.
I bleed like nobody else.
When somebody has convinced you that you're not worth anything to anybody anymore, and they spend a lot of time doing it, you start believing it yourself.
For me, it's about camaraderie. My whole life is like, if something's going on, nothing ever preceded fun. I always put my friends and the fun and the business ahead of everything.
If you have notoriety, you can dress any way you want to dress. That's the way it is. I just like to get dressed up. I think that they go hand in hand - notoriety and people lookin at ya. If they look at ya, either you look like a million dollars, or you don't. A guy can have a phenomenal body, but if the suit doesn't fit him, forget it.
To be the man, you gotta beat the man!
I can take more punishment than anyone in the business.
I feel great. I had a blood clot. It was a bad deal. But when I look at my friends with hip replacements, knee replacements, shoulder replacements, neck surgeries, back surgeries, I'll take the blood clot.
I spent more money on one robe than guys spend in five years.
I was really good at being a bad guy.
If you don't like it, learn to love it!
None of this was written to hurt anybody's feelings.
I'm every woman's dream and every man's nightmare.
Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest line.
Without your health, you've got nothing going on. I thank God every day for good health.
All the women want to be with me, all the men want to be like me.
Nobody has wrestled everybody in the business like I have, especially not Bret Hart.
In order to be the man, you have to beat the man.
I'm Ric Flair! The Stylin', profilin', limousine riding, jet flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin' n' dealin' son of a gun!
